        <p>Nobody wants to talk about constipation. But if you’re among the 1 in 6 adults<br>
             who are regularly backed up, oatmeal can be a great way to get things moving again.<br>
             1 But it’s hardly the only food that can help you poop. Truth is, there are lots of.<br>
              other tasty breakfast foods that can also help ease constipation.<br>

            Whether you’re suffering from oatmeal fatigue or just want to mix things up,<br>
             these dietitian-approved breakfast foods can give you the push you’ve been looking for.</p>
             <h1>The 6 Best Breakfast Foods to Help You Poop That Aren’t Oatmeal</h1>
             <h3>1. Ready-to-Eat Whole-Grain Cereal</h3>
             
                Finding time to go in the morning can be tricky enough. When you’re in a hurry<br>
                 to get out the door, a bowl of fiber-rich whole-grain cereal can do wonders to kickstart<br>
                  your digestive system, says Sylvia Klinger, M.S., RDN, a nutritionist and owner of Hispanic<br>
                   & Multicultural Nutrition Communications, <br>
                LLC. That’s because whole grains are rich in digestion-friendly fiber.<br>
                 Considering that 90% of women and 97% of men don’t get the 28 to 34 grams we need daily, <br>
                 that’s good news for just about everyone.<br>
                 

However, not all whole-grain cereals are equally effective. Look for brands that list whole grains like whole wheat, bulgur,<br>
 barley, oats or quinoa as the first ingredient and contain at least 3 g of fiber per serving. While you’re at it, check the<br>
  nutrition label for added sugars, as some cereals pack high amounts of the sweet stuff. A reasonable limit<br>
   is no more than 10 g of sugar per serving.

    2.KIWI
     </h3>
   
   <p> We don’t have to tell you that prunes are great for relieving constipation.<br>
     But they’re not the only fruits that can get things moving. <br>
     “Kiwis are my go-to recommendation for my constipated patients,” says Kate Scarlata M.P.H., RDN, <br>
     a dietitian specializing in gastrointestinal health and co-host of The Gut Health Podcast.<br>
      Research reveals that kiwis may help people with constipation go more frequently for several reasons.<br>
       First, their fiber (2 g per fruit) helps pull water into your gut for better lubrication.3,4 And unlike <br>
       other high-fiber foods, they won’t make you gassy and bloated, thanks to actinidin, an enzyme that aids digestion.5<br>
     Aim for two each day, says Scarlata. She likes to cut, chop and freeze them in advance to add to smoothies.<br></p>
     <h3>3. Blackberries</h3>
     <p>No time to slice a kiwi? Go for blackberries. One cup of blackberries delivers 8 g of<br>
         digestion-friendly fiber.6 That’s as much as you’d get from 2 cups of cooked oatmeal!7 <br>
         “They also contain a natural laxative, called sorbitol, which pulls water into the gut and can<br>
          help soften stools for easier evacuation,” says Scarlata. And while fresh berries are a win for<br>
           digestive health, so are frozen berries. They’re super convenient, don’t spoil quickly and are less expensive<br>
            off-season. Blend them <br>
        into a Mixed-Berry Breakfast Smoothie or one of these tasty, <br>
        dietitian-approved frozen berry recipes.</p>
