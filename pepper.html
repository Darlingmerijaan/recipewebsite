    <h3>Black and white pepper come from the same plant, Piper nigrum.<br>

    <p>
    Widely used in cuisines around the world, peppercorns' <br>
    roots are traceable to South India. Tellicherry peppercorns,<br>
     grown in Thalassery, a city on the Malabar coast of Kerala,<br>
      are considered some of the finest peppercorns in the world. <br>
      Both black and white peppercorns are small dried berries from the same vine. <br>
    The difference lies in when the berries are harvested and how they are processed.</p>
    <h1>What is black pepper?</h1>
    <p>Black peppercorn berries are picked while still green.<br> 
        They are allowed to ferment, and are then sun-dried <br>
        until they shrivel and turn a brownish-black color, which is why the <br>
        texture of black peppercorns is crinkly.</p>
       <h1>What is white pepper?</h1> 
       <p>White pepper comes from berries that are picked at full ripeness. <br>
        The berries are soaked in water to ferment,<br> 
        and then the outer layer is removed, leaving only the inner, <br>
        light-colored seed. This is why the texture of white <br>
        peppercorns is smooth compared to that of black peppercorns.</p>
        <h1>How do they differ?</h1>
        <p>Aside from the way they are produced, black and white peppers differ significantly in flavor. <br>
            Black pepper imparts a spicy, piquant undertone to foods. It is bold and floral.<br>
             Black pepper can make your mouth tingle! White pepper is generally milder in<br>
              heat compared to black pepper. It is grassy and more earthy.</p>
        <h1>How do I store whole and ground peppercorns?</h1>
        <p>Whole peppercorns hold their freshness and flavor longer than ground<br>
             pepperâ€”all the more reason to buy a spice grinder. When stored in a sealed container in a cool,<br>
              dry place, peppercorns are good for two to four years, according to the USDA. In contrast,<br>
               ground pepper is good for only two to three years. Although ground pepper is convenient,<br>
                it's best bought in small quantities and replaced often. To make sure you get the freshest flavors from your peppercorns, <br>
            make sure to incorporate them into your cooking as much as possible. 
            Try not to let them languish in your pantry.</p>
