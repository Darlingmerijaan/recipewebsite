        <h1>Pumpkin Spice Latte Nutrition Facts</h1>
        <p>
            A pumpkin spice latte (PSL) is a popular seasonal beverage made with espresso, <br>
            steamed milk, a mix of traditional autumn spices (like cinnamon, nutmeg and clove)<br>
             and often pumpkin-flavored syrup. While it’s delicious and comforting, the drink’s <br>
             nutritional profile can vary widely depending on the size, ingredients and how it’s prepared.<br>

    What Happens to Your Body When You Drink a Pumpkin Spice Latte Every Day
 </h1>
 <h3>
    You May Drink More Caffeine
 </h3>
 Drinking a pumpkin spice latte every day increases your daily caffeine intake, <br>
 which can have both positive and negative effects. On the plus side, moderate caffeine consumption <br>
 has been linked to improved focus, alertness and even a lower risk of certain diseases like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease.<br>2 
 However, too much caffeine can lead to increased anxiety, digestive issues and disrupted sleep patterns. The 2020-2025 Dietary<br> 
 Guidelines for Americans recommends consuming at most 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, which is about the amount found in <br>4 
 cups of drip coffee.3 
 It’s important to monitor how much caffeine you’re consuming to avoid any potentially negative effects.
